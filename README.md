# Hey, I'm Aarnav 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the **University of Washington** who loves solving challenging problems, whether it’s building tech solutions or analyzing financial trends. I’m driven by the excitement of pushing boundaries—whether it’s developing data tools or exploring new ways to look at markets. I enjoy the process as much as the outcome, and I'm always on the lookout for impactful projects.

### What I’m currently up to:
- 💻 Building [ReceiptBeyond](https://github.com/hcp-uw/receipt-beyond) – a mobile app that helps users maximize savings by analyzing spending habits and identifying budget-friendly stores.
- 📊 Exploring the intersection of **technology and finance**, with a focus on creating smarter financial models and AI-driven insights.
- 🚀 Always learning something new by building projects to make an impact on the people around me.

### Let’s collaborate on:
- 🤖 Machine learning projects (especially those involving **AI** or **finance**)
- 💡 Creative tech solutions that challenge the norm and solve real-world problems.
